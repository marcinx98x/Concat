//! Turning a timeline plus a timestamp into one finished frame.
//!
//! Rendering splits in two, and the split is the important part of this crate:
//!
//! 1. [`plan`] answers "what is on screen at this instant, from where, and how
//!    strongly". It touches no pixels and does no IO, so it is fast, exactly
//!    testable, and identical for the CPU and GPU backends. The executor
//!    fills the plan out with the decoded pictures and everything the
//!    model has no field for, and a [`FramePlan`] is then the whole
//!    description of the frame.
//! 2. [`compositor`] takes that plan and nothing else, and draws it.
//!
//! Step 2 is the GPU's alone: [`WgpuCompositor`] draws every frame, on the
//! platform's software adapter where a machine has no GPU. The CPU
//! compositor that used to be the reference is kept in the tests only, as
//! the oracle the GPU's parity suite checks it against.
