//! The editing session: a project, its id mint, and undo.
//!
//! Undo is whole-state snapshots, and they are cheap: the project's
//! timelines and clips sit behind `Arc`, so a snapshot copies pointers and
//! a command copies only the clip it writes to. Impossible to get wrong in
//! the way inverse operations are, and a heavy project's two hundred undos
//! are a few megabytes, not a few hundred.
//!
//! Two refinements on "one snapshot per command":
//!
//! - A **gesture** is one undo step. A knob being dragged commits on every
//!   pause of the pointer; the caller names the gesture, and commits that
//!   name the same gesture as the last recorded step fold into it. See
//!   [`Editor::apply_within`].
//! - **View state is not an edit.** Which timeline tab is showing, and the
//!   order of the tabs, is saved with the document but never recorded in
//!   history: undo steps back through what changed the picture, not
//!   through what the person was looking at.
