//! A package's shader: what it declares, checked and laid out at load.
//!
//! A WGSL package writes two things and nothing else: a `Params` struct
//! whose fields are its knobs, and `fn effect(uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32>`,
//! the colour it wants at a point of the layer. Everything around that -
//! the bindings, the frame's size and time, the vertex stage, the mixing of
//! the result back over the untouched layer by intensity - is the host's,
//! and is stitched on here so every package shares one contract and no
//! package can bind things differently.
//!
//! The contract comes in editions, chosen by the manifest's `format` and
//! its `[wgsl]` space ([`Contract`]). From format 2 a shader samples the
//! compositor's working space as it is - linear light, unclipped, 1.0 the
//! white of an SDR picture - and is given the scene-linear library:
//! exposure in stops, a log space for what the eye judges, contrast and
//! saturation that never clip. A format 2 look that asks for the display
//! space is handed the same picture in the display encoding, still
//! unclipped, with the grading helpers it was drawn with made safe past
//! white, and its result is taken back into light before it is mixed. A
//! picture package written for format 1, before the working space was
//! linear, is refused: the packages that shipped so were ported or retired
//! (step 5 of the HDR plan), and an old link to a retired one opens as its
//! stand-in where it has one (`[[replaces]]`).
//!
//! The stitched module is parsed and validated when the package loads, the
//! same way a chain template is, so a broken shader is a load error and not
//! a black frame. Its `Params` struct is read back through naga for the
//! offset of every field, which is how a clip's settings become the bytes
//! of a uniform buffer without a package having to say anything about
//! layout.
//!
//! From format 2 a package may draw in several passes: each
//! `[[wgsl.pass]]` names a picture, `fn <target>(uv)` draws it, and the
//! passes after it - `effect`, the last, among them - read it through
//! `<target>_at(uv)`. The host binds each picture beside the layer, gives
//! every pass an entry point of its own (`fs_<target>`, then `fs_main`),
//! and refuses at load a pass that reads a picture not yet drawn. The
//! pictures hold what the passes return, untouched: only the last pass's
//! colour is taken back into light and mixed by intensity.
